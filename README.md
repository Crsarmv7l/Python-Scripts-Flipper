# Python-Scripts-Flipper
A variety of Python scripts for generating valid Flipper Signals

After the work on the TPMS-Flipper project https://github.com/Crsarmv7l/TPMS-Flipper, I have continued to build Flipper Zero signal generating python scripts on a semi-random basis. The goals are to become better acquainted with python, and continue learning about RF signals analysis and generation

All Python scripts contained here are my own work

- Code_gen from this project is used to generate the Flipper subs in conjunction with my scripts and timing setups https://github.com/triq-org/tx_tools
- Protocol information is obtained from rtl_433 https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433

I make no promises as to the quality of the python on here, only that anything posted WILL generate a valid reading on rtl_433 when transmitted from the Flipper.
